## Unsolved Problems

* Due to issues with Instagram's API policies, a third-party service was used to embed a widget that allows Instagram images to populate on our zoo show page. As it stands now, the widget can only display images from a single Instagram account, i.e. @smithsonianzoo.

* In an attempt to keep our code as DRY as possible, we started to create a custom directive for our animal index views, but ran into issues because the link that directs a user to each animal's respective show page is different.

* Converting the modal from Vanilla JS to AngularJS was difficult. 

## Future Plans

* Should policies with Instagram's API change, this app will pull images from Instagram's API to populate view pages with images marked with relevant hashtags and geo-locations.

* Add more data from other zoos and animals.
