**ZoosnapZ: Snapshots of the Washington D.C. National Zoo**

**http://zoosnapz.herokuapp.com/**

**ZoosnapZ** is a full stack application comprised of an API developed in Ruby on Rails that is connected to a front end built with AngularJS.

The Smithsonian National Zoological Park in Washington D.C. (commonly known as the National Zoo) hosts a large quantity of information about the 1,800 different species that reside there. However, it can sometimes be hard to look at informational placards when there are large crowds. Furthermore, the National Zoo website is hard to navigate, and does not implement responsive design for mobile devices on the third and fourth levels of the website.

That's where **ZoosnapZ** comes in! **ZoosnapZ** is a mobile-friendly repository of animal information and content at the zoo. It currently contains information on some popular mammals and reptiles, and it will later contain more information about fish, amphibians, and birds. In addition to containing information about the animals, the application also connects to the @smithsonianzoo Instagram&reg; account to deliver the latest social content to users.

Next time you visit the zoo, check out [**ZoosnapZ**](http://zoosnapz.herokuapp.com/) on your mobile device to learn more about the zoo, the animals, and to explore the latest photo and video content!
